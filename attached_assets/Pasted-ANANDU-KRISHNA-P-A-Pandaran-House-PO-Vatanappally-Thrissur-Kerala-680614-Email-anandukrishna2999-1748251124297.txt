SUMMARY
I am an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with a comprehensive foundation in supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement,
and deep learning techniques. Currently in the final semester of my MCA, I am developing PeerLearn—an advanced AI-
powered mentorship platform that leverages recommendation systems and real-time mentor matching to transform EdTech.
For 9 years, I managed ERP billing and team operations while pursuing my passion for technology. I self-taught Python,
advanced ML techniques, and AI automation to address real-world business challenges. I am continuously upskilling through
hands-on projects and Coursera’s Machine Learning Specialization (ongoing since March). Additionally, I build AI agents
using n8n to automate data collection, feature engineering, and workflow optimization. My goal is to create innovative,
scalable AI solutions and eventually lead as a Project Manager/CTO in the AI domain.
